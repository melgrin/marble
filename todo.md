- ui
  - slider for terrain height
  - tile size/count adjustment?
  - minimap
    - image
    - camera position
    - camera rotation
- figure out why there are gaps between tiles.  height map edge weird behavior?  example: lat 59.988696, lon -150.170750
- background thread for tile loading.  cancellable when moving fast etc.
- lat/lon usually aren't 1:1 proportional, but I'm pretending they are; image stretched, at least slightly
- experiment with larger tile sizes or more tiles in pool
- figure out correct height for terrain
- handling for all image grids (A1, C2, etc)
  - download all?
  - disk space vs load time?
- osm? borders, places, buildings
- place search?
