- ui
  - escape for toggle, and maybe minimize Debug window
  - update shortcuts. at least don't use F9-F12 because the debugger intercepts those
  - loaded image info?
- minimap
  - image
  - camera position
  - camera rotation
  - current tiles
- debug why there are gaps between tiles.  height map edge weird behavior?  example: lat 59.988696, lon -150.170750
- debug why there seems to be 56 tiles, despite 10800 / 200 == 54.  seeing max tile y index of 55 and min tile y index of -1!
- first time downloads/setup from freshly-cloned repos
- background thread for tile loading.  cancellable when moving fast etc.
- lat/lon usually aren't 1:1 proportional, but I'm pretending they are; image stretched, at least slightly
- experiment with larger tile sizes or more tiles in pool
- figure out correct height for terrain
- handling for all image grids (A1, C2, etc)
  - download all?
  - disk space vs load time?
- osm? borders, places, buildings
- place search?


- some visual issues with tile debug mode
  - blank black rectangle in the upper left of screen
  - black rectangles that show tile info disappear the moment the left edge goes off the screen
