There's two images, topo and color.
Both are manually cropped to be the Seattle region.
Topo is used to make a heightmap.
Color is used as a texture, overlaid on the heightmap.

todo:
- crop dynamically from larger images
- some stuff going on with jpg/png with color map
- lat/lon ties.  topo map is geotiff, so should have tie points.  see a/geotiff.  want to specify lat/lon and make point appear in world
- multiple regions
  - search/select
  - streaming
- osm borders, places, buildings
