## Building

First build:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
vcvarsall x64
cd deps
build.bat
cd ..
cl build.c
build.exe
```

Subsequent builds:
```
build.exe
```


## Running

```
.\build\bin\marble.exe
```

## How does it work?

- There are two images, topographic and color (BMNG).
- Both are of the same region ("A1" region from NASA's global image grid, currently).
- Topographic is used to make a heightmap.
- Color is used as a texture, overlaid on the heightmap.
